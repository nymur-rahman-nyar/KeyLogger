# KeyLogger
This project is a **KeyLogger** implemented in Python, designed for **ethical and educational purposes** in the field of cybersecurity. It demonstrates the use of Python for capturing keyboard input while adhering to ethical guidelines.

## üìã Features
- Captures all keystrokes, including special keys, and logs them in real time.
- Buffers data to reduce I/O overhead, improving efficiency.
- Saves logs in timestamped files for better organization and tracking.
- Handles program termination gracefully to avoid data loss.
- Encapsulated in an object-oriented design for modularity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for implementation.
- **pynput**: A library for monitoring keyboard input.
- **logging**: For structured and efficient log management.
- **os** and **datetime**: For managing log files and timestamps.

## üö® Ethical Use Notice
This keylogger is built **exclusively for educational purposes** and is intended to demonstrate technical capabilities in:
- Cybersecurity practices.
- Ethical hacking simulations.
- Forensics and debugging tools.

**Unauthorized use of keylogging software is illegal and unethical.** Always obtain proper consent before deploying this tool.
